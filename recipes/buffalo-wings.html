        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 small chicken wings</li>
            <li>⅙ teaspoon seasoned salt, or to taste</li>
            <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>⅘ teaspoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>⅓ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>⅙ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>⅙ teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>⅔ (12 fluid ounce) bottle Buffalo wing sauce (such as Frank's®), or to taste</li>
            <li>2 ½ tablespoons and ½ teaspoon vegetable oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li>Season chicken wings lightly with seasoned salt.</li>
            <li>Mix flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and paprika together in a wide, shallow bowl. Press wings into flour mixture to coat and arrange onto a large plate so they do not touch. Refrigerate coated wings for 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Dredge wings again in flour mixture and return to the plate. Refrigerate wings again 15 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Fry chicken wings in hot oil until crisp and no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, 9 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Transfer fried wings to a large stainless steel bowl. Drizzle sauce over the wings and toss to coat.</li>
        </ol>
